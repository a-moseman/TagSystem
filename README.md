An implementation of a tagging system. Rather than organizing content by hierarchy, tags mitigate unpleasant category duplication. This system is designed as a stand-alone service and is intended to be used by multiple dependent services. So, rather than having a tagging system built into each service, they can simply rely on this one. Additionally, this allows for tags to be reused.
